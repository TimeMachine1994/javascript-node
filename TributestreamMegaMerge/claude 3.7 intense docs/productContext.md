## Why We're Building Tributestream

Tributestream addresses the growing need for accessible, high-quality memorial livestreaming services. In an increasingly connected yet geographically dispersed world, many people are unable to attend memorial services in person. Tributestream bridges this gap by providing a dignified, reliable platform for families to share memorial services with loved ones who cannot attend in person.

Our mission is to help families honor their loved ones by making memorial services accessible to everyone, regardless of location, while maintaining the dignity and respect these important life events deserve.

### Problem 2: Memorial Service Documentation
