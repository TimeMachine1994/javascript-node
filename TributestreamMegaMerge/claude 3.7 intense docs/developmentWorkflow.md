# Development Workflow

*Last updated: February 25, 2025*

## How We Work on This Project

The Tributestream project follows a structured development workflow designed to maintain code quality, ensure consistent progress, and facilitate collaboration among team members.

### Development Lifecycle

1. **Planning**
   - Requirements gathering and analysis
   - Task breakdown and estimation
   - Sprint planning and prioritization
   - Documentation updates

2. **Development**
   - Feature branch creation
   - Implementation following coding standards
   - Self-testing and code review preparation
   - Documentation of new functionality

3. **Review**
   - Code review by peers
   - Addressing review feedback
   - Final quality checks
   - Approval for integration

4. **Integration**
   - Merging to development branch
   - Automated testing
   - Staging deployment
   - Integration testing

5. **Deployment**
   - Production deployment planning
   - Deployment execution
   - Post-deployment verification
   - Monitoring and feedback collection

### Branch Strategy

We follow a modified Git Flow approach:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - Individual feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `hotfix/*` - Emergency fixes for production

### Commit Conventions

Commit messages follow the Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types include:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(auth): implement remember-me functionality

- Add checkbox to login form
- Store persistent token in secure cookie
- Update authentication service to handle persistent sessions

Closes #123
```

## Testing Patterns

### Testing Approach

We employ a multi-layered testing strategy:

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Component-level tests for UI components
   - Function-level tests for utilities and helpers
   - Mock-based tests for API interactions

2. **Integration Testing**
   - API endpoint testing
   - Component interaction testing
   - State management testing

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - User flow testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing
   - Mobile responsiveness testing

### Testing Tools

- **Unit Testing**: Vitest for component and utility testing
- **Component Testing**: Testing Library for component interaction testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright for browser automation
- **Manual Testing**: Structured test plans for new features

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests alongside feature development, not after
- Aim for high coverage of critical paths
- Focus on behavior testing over implementation details
- Include edge cases and error scenarios
- Document test scenarios for complex features

## Release Process

### Release Cycle

We follow a bi-weekly release cycle:

1. **Sprint Planning** (Day 1)
   - Review backlog and prioritize tasks
   - Assign tasks to team members
   - Set sprint goals and expectations

2. **Development Phase** (Days 2-8)
   - Implement assigned tasks
   - Conduct code reviews
   - Merge completed features to develop

3. **Stabilization Phase** (Days 9-10)
   - Freeze feature development
   - Focus on bug fixes and testing
   - Prepare release documentation

4. **Release Preparation** (Day 11)
   - Final QA on staging environment
   - Create release branch
   - Update version numbers and changelogs

5. **Deployment** (Day 12)
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor for issues
   - Communicate changes to stakeholders

### Versioning

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **Major version** (x.0.0): Incompatible API changes
- **Minor version** (0.x.0): New functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version** (0.0.x): Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Hotfix Process

For critical issues in production:

1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Implement and test fix
3. Review and approve
4. Merge to main and develop
5. Deploy to production
6. Update version number (patch increment)

## Project-Specific Standards

### Code Style

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Follow ESLint rules for code quality
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs

### Component Structure

- One component per file
- Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Document component usage with JSDoc comments

### State Management

- Use Svelte 5 runes for component-level state
- Use singleton state classes for application-wide state
- Document state dependencies and side effects
- Minimize prop drilling through proper state management

### API Integration

- Use typed API responses
- Implement proper error handling
- Use loading states for asynchronous operations
- Cache responses when appropriate

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs and components
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Include examples for complex functionality
- Document known limitations and edge cases
