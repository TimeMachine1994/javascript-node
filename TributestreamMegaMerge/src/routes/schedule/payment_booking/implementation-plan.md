# Dynamic Checkout Component Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a comprehensive checkout component that combines calculator pricing data, user information, and payment processing into a seamless experience.

## Component Structure

### 1. CheckoutContainer.svelte
- Main container component orchestrating the checkout flow
- Manages overall state and step progression
- Handles data persistence and validation

### 2. OrderSummary.svelte (Enhanced existing implementation)
- Display line items from calculator
- Show subtotals and fees
- Responsive layout for mobile/desktop
- Collapsible on mobile for better UX

### 3. BuyerInformation.svelte
- Pre-populated from user metadata
- Editable fields with validation
- Fields:
  - First Name
  - Last Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Company (optional)

### 4. BillingDetails.svelte
- Address form with validation
- Option to use different shipping address
- Country/State selection with proper formatting
- Address verification integration (future enhancement)

### 5. PaymentForm.svelte (Enhanced CcForm)
- Secure credit card input using Square
- Save card for future use option
- Clear error handling
- Loading states
- Success confirmation

## Data Flow
1. Calculator provides pricing data through props
2. User metadata pre-populates buyer information
3. Form state managed using Svelte runes ($state)
4. Validation occurs at field and form level
5. Payment processing handled through Square integration

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
interface CheckoutState {
  currentStep: number;
  orderData: PricingDetails;
  buyerInfo: PersonalDetails;
  billingAddress: Address;
  shippingAddress?: Address;
  useShippingAddress: boolean;
  paymentMethod: 'card' | 'invoice';
  saveCard: boolean;
}
```

### Validation Rules
- Required fields clearly marked
- Email format validation
- Phone number formatting
- Address validation
- Credit card validation through Square

### Error Handling
- Field-level error messages
- Form-level validation summary
- Payment processing errors
- Network error recovery

### Loading States
- Initial data loading
- Address verification
- Payment processing
- Success confirmation

## UI/UX Considerations

### Layout
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Clear step indication
- Collapsible sections
- Sticky order summary on desktop

### Visual Feedback
- Loading indicators
- Success/error states
- Field validation indicators
- Clear call-to-action buttons

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation
- Error announcements
- Focus management

## MVP Features
1. Basic form with required fields
2. Square payment integration
3. Order summary display
4. Simple validation
5. Success/error handling
6. Responsive layout

## Future Enhancements
1. Address verification
2. Save payment method
3. Enhanced error recovery
4. Analytics integration
5. Receipt generation
6. Email confirmation

## Testing Strategy
1. Component unit tests
2. Integration tests for form submission
3. Payment flow testing
4. Responsive design testing
5. Accessibility testing

## Implementation Steps
1. Create base component structure
2. Implement form layouts
3. Add validation logic
4. Integrate Square payments
5. Add loading states
6. Implement error handling
7. Add success flow
8. Style and responsive design
9. Testing and refinement

## Technical Dependencies
- Square.js for payments
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- SvelteKit for routing/data
- TypeScript for type safety

This plan provides a structured approach to building the checkout component while maintaining MVP principles. We can proceed with implementation once this plan is approved.
