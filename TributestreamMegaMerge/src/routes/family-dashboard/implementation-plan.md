# Schedule Page Implementation Plan

## Overview
We need to update the schedule page to include a new UI that shows payment status, event details, action buttons, and a livestream schedule section. The implementation needs to preserve existing functionality while adding new features.

## Current State
- Page fetches user meta data from server
- Handles calculator entries and memorial data
- Uses TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Implements responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Script Updates
- Maintain existing interfaces and data structures
- Add new form data parsing and flattening logic
- Integrate with current calculator entries handling
- Ensure proper typing for all new data structures

### 2. UI Components
- Payment Status Bar
  - Green status indicator
  - Payment completion message
  
- Event Overview Card
  - Title section
  - Location details
  - Start time
  - Notes section
  - Media placeholder
  
- Action Buttons
  - Upload Media
  - Edit Schedule
  - Transfer Contact
  - Invite Others
  
- Livestream Schedule Section
  - Schedule table with headers
  - Individual schedule entries
  - Edit functionality
  - Responsive design for mobile

### 3. Data Integration
- Connect flattened form data to UI components
- Ensure proper data flow from server to components
- Handle edge cases and loading states
- Implement error handling for data parsing

### 4. Styling
- Maintain consistent Tailwind CSS classes
- Ensure responsive design works across devices
- Implement proper spacing and layout
- Maintain accessibility standards

### 5. Testing Considerations
- Verify data parsing and display
- Test responsive design breakpoints
- Ensure all buttons and interactions work
- Validate error handling

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. Server fetches user meta data
2. Client parses calculator entries
3. Form data is flattened and processed
4. UI components receive and display data

### Key Components
- Payment Status Component
- Event Details Card
- Action Buttons Grid
- Livestream Schedule Table

### Type Safety
- Maintain existing TypeScript interfaces
- Add new interfaces for flattened form data
- Ensure proper typing for all components

## Next Steps
1. Implement script section updates
2. Add new UI components
3. Integrate data flow
4. Test and verify functionality
5. Review and refine implementation
